# Description
The given code is a Python implementation of a numerical method for solving a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the behavior of a fluid flowing over a flat plate. The code uses a finite difference scheme to discretize the PDEs and solve them iteratively over a time interval.

The variables in the code represent physical quantities such as temperature, concentration, and velocity, and the code calculates various quantities such as skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. The code also includes some constants and parameters that define the physical properties of the fluid and the plate, as well as the numerical parameters of the method.

The program solves using three different methods: the Shooting Collocation Method (SCM), the Galerkin Weighted Residual Method (GWRM), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

. **Constants**: The script defines various physical constants and parameters, such as density, viscosity, surface temperature, thermal conductivity, heat transfer coefficient, specific heat capacity, heat flux, length, area, volume, Prandtl number, and Rayleigh number.

2. **Shooting Collocation Method (SCM)**: The `solve_scm` function solves the problem using the SCM, which involves solving an initial value problem using the `solve_ivp` function from `scipy.integrate`.

3. **Galerkin Weighted Residual Method (GWRM)**: The `williamson_model_gwrm` function defines the model equations for the GWRM, and the `boundary_conditions` function specifies the boundary conditions. The `solve_gwrm` function solves the problem using the GWRM, which involves solving a boundary value problem using the `solve_bvp` function from `scipy.integrate`.

4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: The `train_ann` function trains an ANN model using the `MLPRegressor` from `sklearn.neural_network`. The `predict_ann` function uses the trained model to make predictions.

5. **Plotting**: The `plot_profiles` function plots the velocity and temperature profiles obtained from the three different methods (SCM, GWRM, and ANN).

6. **Execution**: The script sets the initial conditions, calls the `solve_scm`, `solve_gwrm`, and `train_ann` functions, and then uses the `predict_ann` function to generate the ANN predictions. Finally, it calls the `plot_profiles` function to display the results.
