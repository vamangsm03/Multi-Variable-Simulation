# Description
The given code is a Python implementation of a numerical method for solving a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the behavior of a fluid flowing over a flat plate. The code uses a finite difference scheme to discretize the PDEs and solve them iteratively over a time interval. The variables in the code represent physical quantities such as temperature, concentration, and velocity, and the code calculates various quantities such as skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. The code also includes some constants and parameters that define the physical properties of the fluid and the plate, as well as the numerical parameters of the method.
